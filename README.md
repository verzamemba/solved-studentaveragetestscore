<p class="ui header product-top-header" title="StudentAverageTestScore Solution">Write a program called StudentAverageTestScore that uses a String array or an ArrayList object to hold the five students’ names, and five characters to hold the five students’ letter grades, and five arrays of five doubles each to hold each student’s set of test scores.

The program should ask the user to enter each student’s name and his or her five test scores. It should display each student’s average test score (90-100, 80-89, 70-79, 60-69, and 0-59) and letter grade (A, B, C, D, and F).

Use nested loops, in which the outer loop handles the student names, and the inner loop handles the current student’s test scores.

This program should have methods that return a specific student’s name, average test score, and a letter grade based on the average.

Write the following methods in the program. Print a project description that tells the user what to do.

calAvg – This method should accept five test scores as an argument and return the average of the test scores.

letterGrade – This method should accept test scores as an argument and return a letter grade for the test score, based on the average of his or her five test scores.

getName – This method should accept student names as an argument and return a student’s name.

The program should display each student’s average test score (formatted to one decimal place) and letter grade.

**Input validation: Do not accept test scores less than zero or greater than 100.
